# DTCN
A clustering model for Task-Oriented Dialogue Clustering (TODC). The proposed model combines context-aware utterance representations and cross-dialogue utterance cluster representations for task-oriented dialogues clustering. An iterative end-to-end training strategy is utilized for dialogue clustering and representation learning jointly.
